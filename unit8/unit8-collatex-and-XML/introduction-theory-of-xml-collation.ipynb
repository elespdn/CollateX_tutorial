    "In the previous units, we have seen how to [collate plain text files](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit5/1_collate-plain-text.ipynb), how to [tokenize](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit6/Tokenization.ipynb) and how to [normalize the input data](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/DiXiT-eu/collatex-tutorial/blob/master/unit7/Unicode-normalization.ipynb). Since some kinds of text do not easily fit into a model, we have also discussed the ways in which you can adjust the algorithms to allow for near-matching. In short, there is already quite a lot you can do to ensure that CollateX produces a collation that fits your research objectives. \n",

    "## Stripping the XML\n",
    "You have also learned that the collation itself is still largely done on the level of the text: we collate strings of plain text characters. However, editors and textual reseachers usually work with XML files that contain transcriptions of the text in question, often encoded according to a specific TEI schema. As you may know, the TEI Guidelines are flexible and allow you to encode a variety of textual phenomena and other information. Therefore the text encoding varies depending on the type of text and the edition you intend to create. Think for instance of documentary markup, linguistic annotation or information about names and people, among others. In short, XML TEI transcriptions are information-rich structured data files. Before these files can be processed by CollateX, they are \"stripped\" of all XML markup because CollateX only accepts plain text strings as input. "

However, other types of TEI XML files are not so easily converted to a linear string. Consider for instance the following, simplified TEI encoding:"

It follows that this editorial decision is not without interpretation. What is more, what is collated is a simplified and linearized rendering of the original transcription: the text of the other layer(s) as well as the remaining information the editor has encoded in the transcription are ignored. A final point to be made has to do with the reason you are sitting here. That is, most editors are not aware of the multiple transformations the input data undergoes. Let's outline for a moment what happens to the text in the most simple case of collation:\n",

It is also possible to influence the token alignment based on the preserved markup elements. Keep in mind though, that the collation itself is still performed with strings of plain text. The overview above would look slightly different: \n",

    "4. The collation output in JSON is transformed again to a desired output format (for instance TEI parallel segmentation or an alignment table). The preserved TEI elements are visualized as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "With each operation, it becomes more difficult to keep track of the exact state of the text: layers of markup are removed and added; both the text and the markup are transformed several times. You see that semi-automated collation is not a neutral process. We can distinguish between the collation algorithm that performs operations on a linear sequence of bits, and the preparatory process of transforming the TEI file into this linear sequence of bits. Where the former can be considered an objective process, the latter sure is not.\n",
