Unit 2 - Elena and Elli

Be clear about terminology
- what is collation? Easy answer: comparison of text. But it is more complicated than that: different editorial traditions attribute different meanings to "collation" and the concepts of collation.
- why is collation used: 1) making editions (critical editions with multiple witnesses and genetic editions); 2) tracking textual transmission; (3) to find the archetype.
- definitions differ depending on the concept of collation. E.g. what is a "base text"? There are two moments in the editorial workflow when the concept of "base text" is used. First, a base text is used only as an “axis of alignment” against which the other witnesses are collated. Second, with base text can be meant the text that serves as the basis of a critical edition. It is important to specify. The same goes for the concept of "version". In practice we only need "something" to compare. This can be a long text, a sentence, a word or even a grapheme. For reasons of clarity the scope of the witness needs to be clear.
